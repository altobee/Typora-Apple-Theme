## Apple Theme for Typora

This theme is based on the original "Github Theme" which is included in Typora. The fonts were replaced with the Apple System font "San Francisco Display Thin". At the moment I've left the rest of the style as it is - maybe I'll change the headlines or the style of the quotes in the future.

For the moment it's enough to change the fonts ;-)
